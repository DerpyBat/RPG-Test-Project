VERY IMPORTANT: This requires nw.dll to run. You can get it here if you're not in the playtesting group chat: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sBfU1NZPpvGMJ3w7qan2yJKXyI8AjWX3/view?usp=sharing

Going to look into Github large file storage to make this work easier, but for now just download it there and put the nw.dll in the folder with the game.exe.
